# Car Accident Severity Prediction

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The World Health Organization describes the road traffic system as the most complex and the most dangerous system with which people have to deal every day. In the last few years, the number of road traffic deaths in the world climbed, reaching 1.35 million in 2016. More particularly in Seattle City, 375 people were killed since 2004, more than a thousand were seriously injured and tens of thousands have suffered small injuries. 

Meanwhile, Big Data Analytics has emerged in the last decade as a set of techniques allowing data scientists to extract meaningful information from large amounts of complex and heterogeneous data. In the context of accident prediction, such techniques provide insights on the conditions leading to an increased risk of road accidents, which in return, can be used to develop traffic-related policies and prevention operations.

### 1.2 Problem

Collision severity is the quantification of the intensity of an impact.  In traffic accident reconstruction, the impact of interest is typically between two vehicles (e.g. automobile, truck, bus, motorcycle, or bicycle), between a vehicle occupant and the vehicle interior, between a vehicle and pedestrian, or between a vehicle and a fixed object (e.g. building, wall, tree, rock, or other landscape feature). 

The significance of determining collision severity in an accident reconstruction is that it is an indicator of the probability of injury. Clearly, the higher the severity level or the greater the accelerations that are involved in a traffic collision, the greater the chances are that an injury will occur. The response of the human body when subjected to a collision with a quantified severity level and principal direction of force forms the bases for biomechanical analyses and occupant protection system performance in a motor vehicle collision.
